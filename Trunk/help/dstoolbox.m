%% dstoolbox
% dstoolbox is a collection of classes used to store and manage access to
% multi-dimensional data sets. These include: <br>
% <matlab:doc('dstable') dstable>, holds a collection of one or more datasets 
% with one or more common dimension vectors.  <br>
% <matlab:doc('dsproperties') dsproperties>, defines the struct used to 
% assign the metadata to a _dstable_. <br>
% <matlab:doc('dscatalogue') dscatalogue>, manages a catalogue of data sets <br>
% <matlab:doc('dscollection') dscollection>, abstract class for clases
% that handle all types of data set (eg imported or model data) which are 
% loaded into dstables and catalogued using dscatalgue. <br>
