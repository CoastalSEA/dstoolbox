# dstoolbox
dstoolbox is a collection of classes used to store and manage access to multi-dimensional data sets. 

## Licence
The code is provided as Open Source code (issued under a GNU General Public License).

## Requirements
dstoolbox is written in Matlab(TM) and requires v2016b, or later. The toolbox is designed as an alternative to a Matlab(TM) _table_ but is also an integral component of the <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox>.

## dstoolbox classes
The classes in the toolbox include:
- <matlab:doc('dstable') dstable>, holds a collection of one or more datasets with one or more common dimension vectors and the associated metadata.
- <matlab:doc('dsproperties') dsproperties>, defines the object used to assign metadata to a _dstable_.
- <matlab:doc('dscatalogue') dscatalogue>, manages a catalogue of data sets that handle a collection of data sets (e.g. imported and model data), which are loaded into _dstables_ and catalogued using _dscatalogue_.

## Schematic

These classes can be used together as illustrated in the following figure:

## Usage
The toolbox is designed to store and manage multi-dimensional data sets, including meta-data of the variables and all dimensions and manage access to a collection of classes that hold data sets using a catalogue. In the schematic outline _dstb_usage_ is a class to illustrate how _dstable_, _dsproperties_ and _dscatalgue_ are used. Data are loaded into a _dstable_ with relevant metadata added to the table and made accessibile using _dsproperties_. Each time a class adds data a record is added using _dscatalogue_. The 'Format Spec'  user functions, shown in the upper part of the figure, are implemented with functions, indicated by 'File Type' and 'Output Type', shown in the lower part of the figure. These define the meta-data of the data set being saved (and any input parameters, or details needed to read and load data from a file, depending on the application).

## See Also
Some slides providing an introduction to the use of the _dstoolbox_ can be found in the /toolbox/doc folder. In addition, the _dstoolbox_ is used in 
the _muitoolbox_ and the use of both toolboxes is illustrated in the _ModelUI App_.
